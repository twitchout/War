War Card Game Overview:

Objective:
The goal of the game is to win all the cards.

Setup:
The deck is shuffled and evenly divided between two players.

Gameplay:
- Each player flips one card from the top of their deck.
- The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards, adding them to their discard pile.
- In the case of a tie (i.e., both players flip cards of the same rank), game does not award a point to either player. Next round will then need to be declared.

Special Features:
- I incorporated light/dark mode for a better user experience.
- Then added a shuffle deck button to mix the cards in the deck.
- I decided to go back and include interactive card reveals, making the game more engaging.
